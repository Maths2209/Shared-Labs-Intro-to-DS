# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML documents. R Markdown allows one to add chunks of R Code within a Markdown document.


## R chunks

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
x <- 1+1
print(x)
```


Knitting uses its own R environment while running chunks individually uses the R environment of the console. Therefore, evaluating the chunk below a second time in a row prints `1` twice while knitting this Rmd file will print `1` and `2`.

```{r}
print(x)
x <- 1
print(x)
```

## Including plots

You can also embed plots. For example:

```{r}
plot(x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(3, 3, 4))
```



# Code from the textbook

Change `eval=FALSE` to `eval=TRUE` in the next chunk and try knitting it. Can you make it knit?


```{r eval=FALSE}
##########################################
# section 3.1 Introduction to R
##########################################

# import a csv file of the total annual sales for each customer
sales <- read.csv("yearly_sales.csv")

# examine the imported dataset
head(sales)
summary(sales)

# plot num_of_orders vs. sales
plot(sales$num_of_orders,sales$sales_total,
     main="Number of Orders vs. Sales")

# perform a statistical analysis (fit a linear regression model)
results <- lm(sales$sales_total ~ sales$num_of_orders)
results
summary(results)
```


# Functions in R

Try to understand the following code and its output. Feel free to edit it to see how its output changes.

```{r}
addition <- function(x, y) {
  sum <- x+y
  return(sum)
}

addition(2, 3)
addition
sd
```
