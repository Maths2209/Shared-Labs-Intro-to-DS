The t-test indicates that if we reject the null hypothesis, there is a 7.94% chance that the null hypothesis is actually true. Using the standard significance level of 0.05, we will not reject the null hypothesis. Though, given our p-value is only slightly larger than 0.05, we face some risk of a Type II error.
